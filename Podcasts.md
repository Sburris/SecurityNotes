## AppSec Specific Podcasts

### Absolute Security
https://absoluteappsec.com/  
Two friends interview other AppSec individuals.  I find this very valuable.

### The Secure Developer

https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/the-secure-developer/  
*I have not listen to this one yet, but it is on my list to evaluate*  
I have high hopes for this podcast, they have some great topics and guests.

## General Computer Security Podcasts

### Risky Business
https://risky.biz/  
Great weekly rundown of the week's security news.  Good commentary.  The Sponsor parts of the episodes are worth listening too.  The hosts has them talk on a particular security area, and lets them pitch their product right at the end, it is really done well and I don't skip those sections.

### Breaking Down Security
https://www.brakeingsecurity.com/  
General IT security, I really like the episodes.

### Defense in Depth
