Overview

This is a my research into answering the question, "As an AppSec team member, what are the risks of using GitHub Actions, what are the current standards/guidelines/best practices, and what tooling is available to help identify these problems."

This is not an introduction into GitHub Actions or original research into identifying novel new attack vectors.  This is a survey of the landscape and possibly creating some rules/tooling to help identify risks.
