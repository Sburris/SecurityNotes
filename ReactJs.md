Declarative language (model UI and state)

## Concepts ##

- Components
  - like functions
  - Input: props, state | Output: UI
  - Reusable and composable
  - `<Component />`
  - Can manage a private state
- Reactive updates
  - React will react
  - Take updates to the browser
- Virtual views in memory
  - Generate HTML using JavaScript
  - No HTML template language
  - Tree reconciliation

- Reactt Component Types
  - Function Component
    - Simpliar
  - Class Component
    - More complex but powerful

React.createElement(string type, string attributes, string childElement)

- a, b = useState(initialStateValue)
  - a = state object (getter)
  - b = updater function (setter)

`<>` = React.Fragment // This is common, so there is the shortcut

- This will render the two componenets together without creating a parent HTML element to insert them into.
