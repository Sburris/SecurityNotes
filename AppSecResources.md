## AppSec Specific Podcasts

### Absolute Security
https://absoluteappsec.com/  
Two friends interview other AppSec individuals.  I find this very valuable.

### The Secure Developer

https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/the-secure-developer/  
Has good converstations around adding security practices to development.

## General Computer Security Podcasts

### Risky Business
https://risky.biz/  
Great weekly rundown of the week's security news.  Good commentary.  The Sponsor parts of the episodes are worth listening too.  The hosts has them talk on a particular security area, and lets them pitch their product right at the end, it is really done well and I don't skip those sections.

### Breaking Down Security
https://www.brakeingsecurity.com/  
General IT security, I really like the episodes.

### Defense in Depth
https://cisoseries.com/subscribe-podcast/  
This takes a particular IT topic that a CISO would be interested in talk on it.
 
### Unsupervised Learning
https://danielmiessler.com/podcast/  
Another curated list of content.  I have found enough value to do the paid membership.  Also has a newsletter to have a written account of what is in the podcast (the episodes are him reading this, sometimes with additional content).
