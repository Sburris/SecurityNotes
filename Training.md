## Advice

- Look for training that call themselves "Defensive" or "Resilient"

- Teach a man to fish and you make a fish harasser.  Teach a man how to stock, kill, clean, and cook animals and a meat eater you make.
- Most training ignores that training an assurance tester does not make a better Software Engineer.  That should be the litmus test for all developer training.
- Train a developer your pentester ways and you teach them to play whack-a-mole.
- Train a developer how to engineer for software quality (ISO 25010) you teach a bad actor to hunt on different grounds.
