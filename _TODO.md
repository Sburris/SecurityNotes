  - Perhaps you don’t have hobbies, or you’re looking for something a little deeper. Here, he suggests learning about science, history, or philosophy. Spending a few hours each night reading Epictetus, Epicurus, and others can help you develop a framework for thinking about life in a deeper and more meaningful way.
- You need to pay VAT in European countries no matter where you're selling from (I use vatlayer.com for getting all the different VAT rates). You generally don't need to pay taxes in other countries until you reach a threshold of earnings / number of sales.

Quaderno.io is another service which track all these different factors for you.

Sales tax / VAT is displayed and charged to customers and you need to pay it to the relevant authorities every quarter.

Then you can pay yourself a salary (which is a cost) from the money you received in the company, based on your country's personal income rates. On what's left, on your company's profit you need to pay corporate tax rate, based on your country's corporate tax rates. On the remaining profits in the company you can generally chose to pay yourself dividends (on which you pay other taxes, based on your country's tax rates on dividends). If you sell your company, you'll have to pay capital tax gain taxes on the profit you made with the company (the delta between the company's capital and how much you sold it for).
