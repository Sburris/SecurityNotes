# Why I started using "Dynamic Data"

When it comes to application security a lot of enficis is put on data, where it comes from, and how trusted it is.  As an industry we use the following terms interchangably:

- user input
- user data
- untrusted data
- untrusted input
- dynamic data
- unsafe input
