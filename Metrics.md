- Compliance to SLA targets
- [NIST Performance Measurement Guide for Information Security - Appendix A](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-55r1.pdf)
- [OWASP Security Qualitative Metrics](https://owasp.org/www-project-security-qualitative-metrics/)
- Simon Bennetts
  - Vulnerability metrics are a good start, eg vulns found by automated scanning, bug bounties / third party and internally. If you pay out for bug bounties then this is a great measure - that translated bugs into real cost :slightly_smiling_face: How long are known security bugs open and unfixed?
  - How many known vulns are these in dependencies?
  - I created a set of security dashboards for web security at Mozilla. As we had so many apps it was really useful to know how active a project was, so things like number of PRs and/or issues raised in the last month. When was the last security audit done (per project)?
Unfortunately I dont think any of this is public, even though it probably could have been. I'll try to remember what else we included, but I'll be very interested to see what else is suggested here...
